Have you ever read a "Chose Your Own Adventure Story" where you make choices and flip through the pages to the part corresponding wiht your choice? They are a great deal of fun and you can create a modern rendition wiht some simple code. This is possible to do in many coding languages, but i'm going to focus on using python is this tutorial. 

**Step 1: Draw your Decision Tree**
  The most important factor in a "Choose Your Own Adventure" is the choices you give to the reader. It's best to plan out these decisions and their possible outcomes before you start to code. 
  
**Step 2: Create Variables to Store the Decisions**
  A good place to start on the code is the decision variables. For every decision in the tree, name a variables and set it equal to the ==input()== function. Inside the input function, in quotes, you can put the prompt for the question the reader is answering.
