  There has been constant discourse on the topic Disc Golf's main two divisions. This discourse has mostly centered around making the FPO division equal to the MPO division. Some factors of equalty are money, coverage, and difficulty of the course. With the dated collected last blog I hope to gain some rudimentary insights into this issue. The goal of this blog is to extract the usefull information I can out of the data I collected. The first step is to look at the varaibles and some number summaries.
  
**Variables and Number Summaries**
  
  Below is a table of all variables with their type and number of entries. It's smart to look at this first and see what youre working iwth in term of variables. Also make sure all varaibles are the desired data type.

  Next we look at a number summaries for each variable. This gives us a good peak into the data we're working with. From our summaries here we can see many sign of skewness in our data. Most vairables seem to be heavily right-skewed, but that ok we excpet that with performance data like this.

**Variable Relationships**

  The next step in the EDA process is to examine relationships between variables. Since the majority of our vairables and numeric it's a no brainer to create a correlation matrix. A correlation matrix puts every variable agaist each other and calculates a correlation coefficient for each combination of variables. The result is a matrix that can be easily scanned for significant relationships. This a great first step for a regression analysis.

What about our categorical variable? since we only have one we're interested in, its a good idea to just try out some variasbles of interest.
