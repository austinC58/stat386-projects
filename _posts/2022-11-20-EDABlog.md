  There has been constant discourse on the topic Disc Golf's main two divisions. This discourse has mostly centered around making the FPO division equal to the MPO division. Some factors of equalty are money, coverage, and difficulty of the course. With the dated collected last blog I hope to gain some rudimentary insights into this issue. The goal of this blog is to extract the usefull information I can out of the data I collected. The first step is to look at the varaibles and some number summaries.
