  There has been constant discourse on the topic of Disc Golf's main two divisions. This discourse has mostly centered around making the FPO division equal to the MPO division in terms of money, coverage, and difficulty of the courses. With the data collected from my last blog, I hope to gain some rudimentary insights into this issue. The goal of this blog is to perform an exploratory data analysis in order to find points of interest in the data. The first step is to look at the variables and some number summaries.  
  
**Variables and Number Summaries**
  
  Below is a table of all variables with their type and number of entries. It’s smart to look at this type of breakdown first and see what you’re working with in terms of variables. Also make sure all variables are of the desired data types.

  Next, we look at a numerical summary for each variable. This gives us a good peak into the data we're working with. From our summaries we can see many signs of skewness in our data. Most variables seem to be heavily right skewed, but that ok we expect that with performance data like this.

**Variable Relationships**

  The next step in the EDA process is to examine relationships between variables. Since the majority of our variables are numeric, it's a no brainer to create a correlation matrix. A correlation matrix puts every variable against each other and calculates a correlation coefficient for each combination of variables. The result is a matrix that can be easily scanned for significant relationships between variables. This is a great first step for a regression analysis. From this matrix we can see that most relationships are what we would expect. For example, the top 10% and 20% being correlated with winning makes sense.

What about our categorical variable? since we only have one we're interested in, its a good idea to just try out some variasbles of interest.
