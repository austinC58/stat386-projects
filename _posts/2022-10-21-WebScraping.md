**Introduction**

  Sports Science is one of my favorite subjects to study on my own time. During the past eight years i've spent countless hours researching how to be the best athlete i can be. I used this information to help myself and others, specefically my wife, have successful atheltic careers at the highschool and colegiate levels. Going into this year i've been worried about leaving all of that behing. Luckily i found a new hobby. Disc Golf! I'm excited to apply my passion for sports science to Disc Golf and share this process with others. 

**Getting Started**

  Most of the time getting started is the hardest part of any project for me, and this is especially true with this one. There are so many different aspects of disc golf that i could look at through data. To keep it simple i decided to start out by exploring the difference in the Mixed(MPO) and Female(FO) divisons. Now that i have an idea, its time to get the data. 
  
 **Gathering Data**
 
  Gathering Data is going to be different for every project. I can't give a step by step process of how to gather data for every project, but i can give insights on how to approach gathering data and show some of my work. First, lets talk about choosing a source of data. When choosing a source you are going to want to check for two things. The valididy of the data and whether is acessible to you. Luckily for me my source, statmando.com, checks off these boxes. Now that we have a source for the data we need to figure out how to extract it. Again, this is going to be different for every project, but for mine i am just going to be using pythons BeautifulSoup package to scrape data. Here is a quick run down of how my process went.
