**Introduction**
  Sports Science is one of my favorite subjects to study on my own time. During the past eight years i've spent countless hours researching how to be the best athlete i can be. I used this information to help myself and others, specefically my wife, have successful atheltic careers at the highschool and colegiate levels. Going into this year i've been worried about leaving all of that behing. Luckily i found a new hobby. Disc Golf! I'm excited to apply my passion for sports science to Disc Golf. 

**Getting Started**
  Most of the time getting started is the hardest part of any project for me, and this is especially true with this one. There are so many different aspects of disc golf that i could look at through data. To keep it simple i decided to start out by exploring the difference in the Mixed(MPO) and Female(FO) divisons. Now that i have an idea, its time to get the data
  
 **Gathering Data**
