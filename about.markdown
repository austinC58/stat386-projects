# About Me

MY name is Austin Carter. I am graduating in applied statistics at the end of this semester. I'm really excited to take this class as my last stats class in my degree. I've been married for over a year now, and my wife is a art and P.E. teacher in Spanish Fork. Both my wife and I were athletes here at BYU. I am now currenlty getting into Disc Golf and its been really fun.
